This is a capstone project to show, practise and test my webdevelopment skills as a fullstack developer.

Deliverables
One Node project for the function of the website

Including at least one EJS file for the structure of the website

Including at least one CSS file for the styling of the website


Features
1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.

2. Post Viewing: The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.

3. Post Update/Delete: Users should be edit and delete posts as needed.

4. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Personal Note: The project will be done without a user login, instead it will be a free write whatever post you want.

Technologies used:
Frontend:
HTML & CSS: Creating the static frontend and aesthetic of the website. Not the main focus of the project, still used however.

Backend:
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.

2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
